	<span class="date">November 09, 2010</span>
	<div class="post-content">
		Retaining walls in Brisbane are limited to 1 metre high unless certification and a engineers design is sought. So the idea is to keep the wall below 1 meter or costs will escalate  before you even get a post in the ground depending on the size and nature of your wall.  A good structural landscaper should know the best remedy and style  to fit your budget. 
<br /><br />
Amongst Brisbane shires there are different regulations in which how close the retaining wall can be built next to the boundary i.e the front roadside or the neighbours. The height of 1 metre is taken from existing ground level, so don't think you can build up the existing height, or you will undermine the strength and the building inspectors sharp eyes.   You can stagger your walls in short distances to get higher than the one meter.
 to check on the distance and regulation on this.
<br /><br />
If your wall is within 1.5mtr from a house or has a vehicle or load bearing traffic a engineers report will be needed.    If the vendor or owner doesn't comply with this regulation they may run into difficulty when selling their house causing headache and costs to get it to comply or have their contract negotiated down as not  its legal.
<br /><br />
Or if a disgruntled  neighbour tells Brisbane council about the illegal retaining wall, the owner may have to remove it, pay for additional work in order for it to comply, or receive a fine. To comply  a  BSA licenced structural landscaper or builder is what you will need to do to get this job done properly, as laws binding the Queensland area will protect you for 6years and 2months on your newly constructed  wall.
<br /><br />
 There are a lot of cowboy landscapers out there without a licence and operating illegally.  There are 3 types of BSA licenses for landscapers to look for 
1:  landscaper
2:  structural landscaper
3:  builder restricted to structural landscaping

C price landscapes has the number  < 2 and 3 licenses.>
The 3rd is the highest license giving a broarder scope of works.
<br /><br />
The first CANNOT  construct your wall legally . A structural landscaper can do all the necessary requirements and have the skills and expertise to build your wall to code and to B.S.A standards on a wall to 1 metre in height .If you are buliding a engineered design wall over 1 metre in height you will need the license of  number 3:  
 builder restricted to structural landscaping and a certifier to produce the certification on completion if it complys with the engineers design drawn before commencement.

 license Check to see if he can produce a license and log on to the BSA website and enter his number and see if he has had any demerit points or past problems or suspension on his license.
<br /><br />
Also he should have a current public liability insurance certificate to show you on request.
<br /><br />
As  drilling deep holes for load bearing posts are required for your brisbane retaining wall your contractor will need to assess a dial a dig report for your address before he commences work and within 30 days of the issued reports, or his public liability insurance will not be covered if he hits your sewage pipes ,telstra cables , fatal power cables, and extremely expensive broadband cables. Beware ..... these costs can run into the millions if he hits a main. 
<br /><br />
Don't be surprised if a rock clause is entered in the contract.  This is standard, as if your  landscaper drills and hits rock this can potentially cost.  
<br /><br />
There are many types of retaining  walls to choose from ranging from treated pine which is the cheapest, hardwood giving greater strength and longevity, or boulders if you are on rock, rendered block, keystone or concrete. Retaining walls are great enabling the creation of terraces or improving the sizes of flat land. 
<br /><br />
Water and drainage problems can occur if your landscaper is uneducated causing erosion and nightmare costs and with the possibility of the all needing to be replaced if it's not done properly. So don't short cut. Get the retaining wall built once and properly with the correct size for drainage and sess pits to cope with your calculated runoff area . 
<br /><br />
If paving is done on the edge of the wall, this too can also cause problems from sinking soil and faster runoff. This is especially a problem in Brisbane given retaining walls are usually on steep run off slopes.

		As more and more subdivision land releases become available across Australia, and many of those blocks of land are on previously un-usable sloping ground, the concept of landscape retaining walls is fast growing. <br><br> 

Landscape design or Landscaping a property is now considered to be essential when building or renovating a house. Not only does it look great and give the property that finished feel and make it more desirable, but it can add value to a home. On land that had been previously thought un-usable for garden space, a retaining wall can mean the possibility of offering a flat garden area behind the wall, or even multi-level garden space with the use of a retaining wall. <br><br> 

The onset of reality tv gardening shows has inspired the home owner to look further into the possibilities that their own land has to offer. The concept of designing a garden to be beautiful and functional is growing more and more popular every day. With companies springing up everywhere, offering the latest and most modern in landscaping design and retaining wall construction, each one as competitive as the last. Landscape retaining wall design is a fast growing and highly skilled industry, with many many qualified, brilliant designers on the market. Obtaining a quote for your garden can be a very simple process.   <br><br> 

There are new products appearing on the market frequently and innovative designs are fast becoming more common place in residential streets. Sandstone blocks or rocks, and "bush" rocks are very common in retaining walls, being durable and strong materials to build with. <br><br> 

When it comes to design, there are many styles available in retaining walls. Large boulders stacked together to form a wall is a commonly used form of retaining wall when dividing two blocks of land for residential building purposes, but for design purposes in the garden space, cut sandstone blocks are very popular. <br><br> 

A variety of colours and textures available to the consumer, means that a design can be customised to suit the needs of the garden owner, and manufactured blocks can often be a very cost effective and design friendly way to meet functionality and style. <br><br> 

Retaining walls don't have to be reserved for the sloping block - they can be used to create garden or planting beds where previously there had been none. They can be used to create seating, or a pond or water feature in an otherwise flat garden space. <br><br> 

Another common use or feature of the retaining wall is the ability to create a multi-level garden and the stairway between them. A stairway can be designed as part of the retaining wall and fit seamlessly in to the retaining wall itself, or could be made in to a feature of the garden, by using stylish colours and textures. <br><br> 

Whether of manufactured stone, naturally occurring boulders or mined rocks, a retaining wall is a great way to inject some style or character in to a garden, while offering functionality in one of many ways.  The increase in the amount of environmentally friendly materials available to the consumer offers an even bigger incentive to landscape your garden, knowing that the work you are doing to change the natural landscape will have the least impact on the environment as possible. <br><br>

		<p>Grasses such as cooch and wintergreen suffer more from dogs doing their business on the lawn. A more drought tolerant, hardy turf/ grass for the Brisbane area is Buffalo palmetto and this will be a harder grass for him to dig holes in.</p>

<p>Have your landscape design incorporate a toilet area where he gets trained to use this area only.  This area can be gravel or sandpit in the far corner tucked away near a lined rubbish tin with a pooper scooper handy.  Possibly bordered with some scented plants such as Jasmine, Rosemary, Lavender or Daphne to help disguise the unpleasants.</p>

<p>Some plants could be a high risk to an excited dog such as Yucca, Dracena or Phoenix palms for example as they their spiky leaves could damage your pets eyes.  Also cactus gardens could pose a similar threat. Log into <a href="http://www.aspca.com/">www.aspca.com</a> to find poisonous plants for dogs so you know what species to avoid in your garden.</p>

<p>Avoid spraying toxic chemicals where your dog could be roaming, or where it could land in his water bowl which may be your water feature.  Don't plant fragile plants around the boundary if your pet likes to patrol the boundary fence when strangers pass by.  You may have to create barriers with timber garden sleepers to avoid him trampling your precious plants in certain areas.  </p>

<p>If he digs holes trying to escape under the boundary fence then a concrete border could be constructed underneath the fenceline to avoid this.</p>

<p>If he digs holes in your mulches you may have to use a heavier mulch like brown pebbles or 100 mil rocks but remember he will need some grass to call his own.</p>
