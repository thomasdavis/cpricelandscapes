		As more and more subdivision land releases become available across Australia, and many of those blocks of land are on previously un-usable sloping ground, the concept of landscape retaining walls is fast growing. <br><br> 

Landscape design or Landscaping a property is now considered to be essential when building or renovating a house. Not only does it look great and give the property that finished feel and make it more desirable, but it can add value to a home. On land that had been previously thought un-usable for garden space, a retaining wall can mean the possibility of offering a flat garden area behind the wall, or even multi-level garden space with the use of a retaining wall. <br><br> 

The onset of reality tv gardening shows has inspired the home owner to look further into the possibilities that their own land has to offer. The concept of designing a garden to be beautiful and functional is growing more and more popular every day. With companies springing up everywhere, offering the latest and most modern in landscaping design and retaining wall construction, each one as competitive as the last. Landscape retaining wall design is a fast growing and highly skilled industry, with many many qualified, brilliant designers on the market. Obtaining a quote for your garden can be a very simple process.   <br><br> 

There are new products appearing on the market frequently and innovative designs are fast becoming more common place in residential streets. Sandstone blocks or rocks, and "bush" rocks are very common in retaining walls, being durable and strong materials to build with. <br><br> 

When it comes to design, there are many styles available in retaining walls. Large boulders stacked together to form a wall is a commonly used form of retaining wall when dividing two blocks of land for residential building purposes, but for design purposes in the garden space, cut sandstone blocks are very popular. <br><br> 

A variety of colours and textures available to the consumer, means that a design can be customised to suit the needs of the garden owner, and manufactured blocks can often be a very cost effective and design friendly way to meet functionality and style. <br><br> 

Retaining walls don't have to be reserved for the sloping block - they can be used to create garden or planting beds where previously there had been none. They can be used to create seating, or a pond or water feature in an otherwise flat garden space. <br><br> 

Another common use or feature of the retaining wall is the ability to create a multi-level garden and the stairway between them. A stairway can be designed as part of the retaining wall and fit seamlessly in to the retaining wall itself, or could be made in to a feature of the garden, by using stylish colours and textures. <br><br> 

Whether of manufactured stone, naturally occurring boulders or mined rocks, a retaining wall is a great way to inject some style or character in to a garden, while offering functionality in one of many ways.  The increase in the amount of environmentally friendly materials available to the consumer offers an even bigger incentive to landscape your garden, knowing that the work you are doing to change the natural landscape will have the least impact on the environment as possible. <br><br>
